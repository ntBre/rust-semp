this time write input as needed, not all at once. the first three all need to
be inside of the 'as needed' part -> iterator returning jobs?
- if I can set up a list of structs containing all the info necessary for a
  job, I can map over that and submit as I go
- use Iter.take(n) to grab the first n, I guess you slice off the front n
  elements of the original slice after that
